data set 2


In the construction of model Aq1, we exclude input measurements of low quality (lower
than A rating), measurements in a deep marine setting, and data from high latitudes
(north of 80N and south of 60S) to reduce the size of the grid, and avoid spatial distortion
from the interpolation in some of the observables used. Hence, the few existing Antarctic
measurements are also excluded (further discussed in main text)
